# FEWD Week3: CSS Layouts

### Description

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions](starting_materials/readme) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

### Real-World Applications

- Style text on your page with Google Fonts

### Technical Requirements

- Use flexbox in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout
- Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the [design file](starting_materials/readme) and according to the JPEG provided
- Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style the page
- Use a background image for the headers
- Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
  - see the readme and Resources below
- Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes
  - Drop caps are the large L's at the beginning of each paragraph, see Resources

#### Bonus

- Link the "Blog" link in the header to the page you've built for this assignment
  - Linking a page to itself with simply refresh the page
- Link the "About" link in the header to the landing page you built last week
  - Check your week2 repo on GitHub for the URL
